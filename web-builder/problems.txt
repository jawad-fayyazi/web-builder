***things to note***
when we change folder name of app we should define path of php files to connect to db
we should change page_id to web_id or projectid



***Things to do***
download all js script instead of link 
make back main app page for creating new websites
should make default page for new web
should not able to create web projects using new id in link like if not exist in db than 404 page not found
make one page index
add dot to indicate current working page
add project / web name








***Problems to note***
preview button is conflicting with side bar
when first time load project, auto save not work
if no page id than its gonna return null which should not
if there is no pages than there should be msg
if there is a completely new project another msg
and if we delte all pages than also a msg should show









***HOSTING***
surge is working 
should have a index.html file

okay netlify is working too
creating websites using its api and deploying using cli
we have to check if domain exists than only deploy as it will update the website make success and error messages and integreate those msg in gjs ui so it will be user freindly
