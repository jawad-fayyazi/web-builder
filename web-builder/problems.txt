***things to note***
when we change folder name of app we should define path of php files to connect to db
we should change page_id to web_id or projectid



***Things to do***
change  page id to project id 
download all js script instead of link 
make back main app page for creating new websites





***Problems to note***
preview button is conflicting with side bar
when first time load project, auto save not work
if no page id than its gonna return null which should not
if there is no pages than there should be msg
if there is a completely new project another msg
and if we delte all pages than also a msg should show
